# crane-optimization
This Jupyter notebook serves as a short (30-60min) introduction to trajectory optimization for robotics applications, by looking at trajectory optimization for an overhead crane using CasADi.

An extended notebook was also developed with more interactivity and more in depth explanations: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/martiabr/crane-optimization/main?filepath=crane-optimization-extended.ipynb)
