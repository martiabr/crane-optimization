    "# Optimization of a robotic crane\n",

    "\n",
    "Continuous optimization is an important area of robotics. Methods and algorithms for optimization helps us to, e.g., reduce energy usage, increase performance, and increase accuracy in robot operations. In this hands-on exercise we give an example on how optimization can be used in robotics and some of the important aspects of optimization – such as \"cost functions\" and \"constraints\". You'll learn about cost functions, constraints and more in the rest of this exercise.\n",

    "**Learning goals:**  \n",
    "- Understand how a <mark>mathematical model</mark> of a robot can be used to produce optimal control algorithms for planning and control.\n",
    "- Understand the concept of <mark>cost functions</mark> and <mark>constraints</mark> in optimization problems and how they are used.\n",

    "We will be studying an overhead crane operating from the ceiling of a production facility. The crane is big and heavy, and it is therefore very important that the tip of the crane is accurately controlled such that we get fast, safe and efficient production.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, for this hands-on task we will consider using <mark>trajectory optimization</mark> to control the overhead crane. The crane has a overhead cart with horizontal position called $r$ and an angle $\\theta$ down to the payload hanger of the crane, as seen in the figure below. The crane has velocity $\\dot{r}$ and the payload has an angular velocity $\\dot{\\theta}$. We let $x = [r \\ \\theta \\ \\dot{r} \\ \\dot{\\theta}]$ be the \"states\" of our system, which we want to control. We can push the \"cart\" with a force $F$ and will try to find a way to decide $F$ over time such that we move the crane system from the \"Start\" position to the \"Target\" position while minimizing speed and force. \n",

    "### Trajectory optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Trajectory optimization, briefly:</b>\n",
    "Optimization is a general framework for minimizing/maximizing some function (subsequently called a cost function), while adhering to constraints. In trajectory optimization we apply optimization to find some optimal trajectory/path for a system, such as a robot, drone, rocket, or in our case, crane. By designing a cost function such that some performance metric for the system is minimized, while considering the dynamics of our system and possibly additional constraints, this can be achieved.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first example we will simply tell the optimizer to minimize the distance to our target position, while trying to reduce the velocity of the crane. We write this mathematically like this:\n",
    "$$J = R_r (r - r_t)^2 + R_\\theta \\theta^2 + R_{\\dot{r}} \\dot{r}^2 + R_{\\dot{\\theta}} \\dot{\\theta}^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is called a *cost function* and since this function is to be minimized, the optimization system will simultaneously try to bring the horizontal position of the cart $r$ to the target $r_t$, while also bringing the angle $\\theta$ to the down position (zero). $R_r$ and $R_\\theta$ are weights that describe how we weigh these two goals against each other. I.e., if $R_r$ is much bigger than $R_\\theta$, then the crane trajectory optimizer will prioritize getting the cart to the target position, and give less priority to getting the crane angle to zero. Small penalities are also added on the velocities $ \\dot{r}$ and $\\dot{\\theta}^2$ with weights $R_{\\dot{r}}$ and $R_{\\dot{\\theta}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will minimize this cost function over a time horizon of 4 seconds – i.e., our crane trajectory optimizer will look up to 4 seconds into the future and optimize the crane movement for this time period. We could have set a longer period, but this would have required more compute power in order to solve the optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete optimization problem will look like this:\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\min_{u} \\quad & \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}{R_r (r_i - r_t)^2 + R_\\theta \\theta_i^2} + R_{\\dot{r}} \\dot{r}_i^2 + R_{\\dot{\\theta}} \\dot{\\theta}_i^2 \\\\\n",
    "    \\textrm{s.t.} \\quad & x_{k+1} = f_d(x_k, u_k) \\quad \\forall k = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1 \\\\\n",
    "    & x_0 = x(0)    \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "We optimize our cost function over the duration of $N$ time steps, while adhering to the dynamics of our system given by the function $f_d$. We also add the constraint $x_0 = x(0)$ to make sure our solution starts in the initial condition $x(0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important part of our optimization problem above is to understand how our system will behave. To this end, we need to make a mathematical model of the crane systems. This mathematical model is given to our optimization problem, such that it can take into account how the crane will move when it plans our desired motion.\n",
